# Predicting F-10 Days 1-7 Based on 2021 Solar Data

Forecasters at the SWPC create a 7-day forecast for daily 10.7 cm Radion Flux (F-10 numbers) based on numerous qualitative and quantitative measures. F-10 numbers often used as a proxy for how active or inactive the Sun is. The higher the number, the more active. Higher F-10 numbers typically correlates to more complex sunspot regions and x-ray flares.* 

This project will determine if a machine learning algorithm can outperform forecasters in predicting F-10 numbers.
